<h2>Error Summary</h2>

<p>
  This component is used at the top of a page to summarise any errors a user has
  made.
</p>

<p>
  When a user makes an error, you must show both an error summary and an error
  message next to each answer that contains an error.
</p>

<p>
  You can view the full implementation details on the Error Summary section of
  the GDS website.
