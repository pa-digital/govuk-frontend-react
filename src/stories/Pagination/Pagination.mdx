<p>
  By default the "Previous" and "Next" links will become hidden when the
  pagination reaches either end of the range.
</p>

<h2>Pagination Display Modes</h2>

<h3>Large Results</h3>

<p>
  When the number of pages rises above 20, the pagination automatically reverts
  to using a large view to show the first, large and mid range options.
</p>

<p>The "Previous" and "Next" options are still displayed as normal.</p>
<h3>Compact View</h3>

<p>
  When the number of pages drops below 3, the pagination automatically reverts
  to using a compact view.
